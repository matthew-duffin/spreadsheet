# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality
This handles the Gui of our spreadsheet model. For our unique feature we added a 'Theme' button that will change the color scheme to dark mode,
light mode, or a special rainbow mode. Rainbow mode comes with a FIDGET MODE that allows you to fully fill in the cell color, as it starts out
not filled in which is immensely satisfying. 

#Partnership
Everything was completed with pair programming. We worked together for all of the code.

#Branching
We didnt use the branching feature and completed everything on the main branch as there didnt seem to be a reason to use branching for what we were doing.

#Design Decisions
Our additional feature is mentioned in the overview in greater detail, but we basically just added 'Themes'. To use the spreadsheet you can click on 
the 'Help' button of the spreadsheet for full instructions. However, a brief rundown, to edit the spreadsheet you must hit file new and when you save 
a spreadsheet it auto saves to the desktop. This was done because if you did not give it a file path, it would try to auto save to the windows 32 folder. 

#Time Spent
Our time estimates seem to be getting more accurate as the semester goes on because we are understanding more how long it takes to complete certain tasks.
For a full breakdown of time spent please see the solution level README. 

#Best Team Practices
The things that we think we excelled at were in using virtual meeting platforms. By using discord we were able to meet more frequently, and it allowed
us to swap roles more frequently as well. We were able to just swap whose screen as being shared and jump from there. Another thing we excelled at was 
listening to each others ideas and being able to brainstorm and troubleshoot together. 

One thing we could improve on is debugging. When one partner was debugging, it was easy for the other partner to fall by the wayside and just let the first partner 
take over. Obviously, this isnt a good example of pair programming and something we can improve on. This would be beneficial because it would probably allow us to 
catch bug faster.
