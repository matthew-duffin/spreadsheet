# Comments to Evaluators:
I found this project to be much easier than the previous assignment. No issues to report. I found the hardest part to be finding a way to get almost all methods 
to run in constant time. The way I solved this problem is by using the correct data structures, a hash set and a dictionary. This allowed me to get constant time on	
all operations

# Assignment Specific Topics
I have tested every case of my code that I can think of and have made sure that every line of my code has been run in the current tester class.
This ensures that every line does what I think it does and that the program should work as intended.
