# Comments to Evaluators:
I found this project to be much easier than assignment 1 as refactoring the code was far easier after getting it working. The hardest thing for me was defining what a variable was considered to
be. However, closer inspection of assignment instructions allowed me to find the answer to this. 

# Assignment Specific Topics
I also found using the validator and normalizer to be a very cool new thing to learn in coding. It is a tool that I plan to use going forward and am glad I was able to learn it.
