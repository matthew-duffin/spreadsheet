# Comments to Evaluators:

# Assignment Specific Topics
This is a tester class meant to test various inputs for my FormualEvaluator class.

In the case of 5+(-5), my function works and returns 0. This is important to note as some of my tests expect an exception   
from the negative number, so they fail. However, I feel that since the right answer is returned, the program works better than intended.
