# Comments to Evaluators:
I found this project to be much easier than assignment 1 as refactoring the code was far easier after getting it working. The hardest thing for me was defining what a variable was considered to
be. However, closer inspection of assignment instructions allowed me to find the answer to this. 

# Assignment Specific Topics
I found getting one hundred percent code coverage to be challenging to achieve. This is because I had to try and come up with a test case that hits each specific condition,
which proved to be more challenging then I thought. I ultimately was able to get to 99% test coverage and decided this was enough for me to feel confident in my program.
