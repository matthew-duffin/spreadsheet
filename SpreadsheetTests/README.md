# Comments to Evaluators:
Assignment 4: This project I found to be nice as a lot of the needed code, We have already written. Being able to rely on my formula class and dependency graphs 
made this assignment much easier as I was confident in what they were doing. I also found it to be challenging to keep track of what was already being done by other pieces of
code that I had already written.

Assignment 5: Assignment five was the most challenging assignment yet. Finding a way to evaluate a cells value,
without constantly reevaluating the formula was a challenge. Luckily I solved it by using classes I already made
and changing certain aspects to get the needed functionality

# Assignment Specific Topics
Testing for this assignment I found to be a bit challenging as often I found myself not being able to test protected
functions or that certain aspect of a method were being tested in different methods. This conceptually was confusing. 

I also found writing tests to be difficult as it is hard to come up with every possible thing that could go wrong in
your code and find a way to deal with it all.
