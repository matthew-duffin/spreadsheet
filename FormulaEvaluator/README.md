# Comments to Evaluators:
I found this assignment to really push my debugging and problem solving skills to their limits. In the end I found myself debugging for hours   
on end looking for several tiny bugs. One of which included a bug where multiple operators outside parenthesis threw an error.  
In order to fix the bug, I had to come up with a solution outside of the algorithmn. Having my skills teseted like this, and ultimately overcoming  
the challenge, has increased my confidence significantly. 

# Assignment Specific Topics
This is my solution to the formula evaluator problem I follow the algorithmn as given and my solution works for rougly 56 tests I created 
in my tester class. In the case of 5+(-5), my function works and returns 0. This is important to note as some of my tests expect an exception   
from the negative number, so they fail. However, I feel that since the right answer is returned, the program works better than intended.
