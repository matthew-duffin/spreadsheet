# Comments to Evaluators:
Assignment 4: This project I found to be nice as a lot of the needed code, We have already written. Being able to rely on my formula class and dependency graphs 
made this assignment much easier as I was confident in what they were doing. I also found it to be challenging to keep track of what was already being done by other pieces of
code that I had already written.

Assignment 5: Assignment five was the most challenging assignment yet. Finding a way to evaluate a cells value,
without constantly reevaluating the formula was a challenge. Luckily I solved it by using classes I already made
and changing certain aspects to get the needed functionality

TA PLEASE READ(Error with autograder on my code): For some reason my autograder keeps saying my tests arent covering majority
of my code. However, on my end I have a hundred percent code coverage. I have exhausted all resources 
and still cannot seem to fix this. If you could please keep this in mind when grading and look at the auto grader
I would appreciate it. You can check Piazza for evidence of it working on my end under piazza post @1036.

# Assignment Specific Topics
Assignment 4: The biggest struggle for me this assignment was dealing with the various types we have. There are several points where you have to determine the type of an object
and make sure you return that type. This caused some issues with type casting that I had to fix. 

Assignment 5: Learning how to write to files in XML wasnt too bad but it required a fair amount of time and 
research with class resources to fully understand what was happening.
